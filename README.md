# Voxel Engine and Terrain Generation


This started as a personal project to create a custom voxel engine, I then hooked up the voxel engine to one of my old terrain generation projects, trying to recreate Minecraft-style terrain. 

These are all the raw code files that are used in the project, so this repository is a WIP.
